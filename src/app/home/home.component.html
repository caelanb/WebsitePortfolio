          <h3>About Me</h3>
          <p>Hi. I am Caelan Bryan and I am a software engineer located in the Pensacola area. I attended the University of Nebraska Omaha where I graduated with a 
             Bachelor of Science in Computer Science in May 2019. During my time at the University of Nebraska Omaha I was interested in the cybersecurity and mathematics 
             classes I was taking and received a minor in both of those subjects. I started working at Navy Federal in November 2019 as a business systems analyst. I have 
             since been expanding my experience working on a variety of projects. My favorite projects at Navy Federal have been the ones where I get to work with different 
             kinds of data. As such, in the summer of 2021, I enrolled in the Data Science Certificate program at the University of West Florida. I completed the certificate 
             with a 4.0 GPA in December 2021 and enrolled in the full Master of Science in Data Science program shortly after. I am expected to complete the program in December 2022. 
             I am ready to begin working in the field of data science and use the knowledge I have gained during my classes.</p>
            <hr>
          <h3>Skills</h3>
          <p>During my undergraduate degree I mostly used Java, some Python, and some Angular to complete class assignments and projects. Working at Navy Federal I have switched to VB.NET 
             and C#.NET to build windows form apps and ASP webpages. I have also gained a lot of experience using Microsoft SQL Server to create reports, retrieve data from outside sources, 
             build infrastructure for different applications, and read/format/write data for file drops. In my graduate program I have spent time working with SAS and R to analyze data.

                    This course covers the foundational concepts and principles underlying the design and implementation of programming languages. Language constructs including 
                    assignment, equality, references, aggregations, scope, encapsulation, and parameter passing are discussed. A central theme is how a particular language 
                    construct relates to the concept of equational reasoning (referential transparency). Formal notations for describing syntax and semantics are presented.

                    This course emphasizes our current dependence on information technology and how its security in cyberspace (or lack thereof) is shaping the global landscape. 
                    Several historical and contemporary global events that have been influenced by the exploitation of information technology motivates topics on cyber crime, 
                    malware, intrusion detection, cryptography, among others, and how to secure one's own data and computer system. Several aspects of this course are geared 
                    towards developing an understanding of the "cyberspace" as a new medium that breaks all geographical boundaries, while highlighting noticeable influences on 
                    it from social, political, economic and cultural factors of a geographical region.

            <h3>About Me</h3>
            <p>Hi. I am Caelan Bryan and I am a software engineer located in the Pensacola area. I attended the University of Nebraska Omaha where I graduated with a Bachelor of Science 
               in Computer Science in May 2019. During my time at the University of Nebraska Omaha I was interested in the cybersecurity and mathematics classes I was taking and received 
               a minor in both of those subjects. I started working at Navy Federal in November 2019 as a business systems analyst. I have since been expanding my experience working on a 
               variety of projects. My favorite projects at Navy Federal have been the ones where I get to work with different kinds of data. As such, in the summer of 2021, I enrolled in 
               the Data Science Certificate program at the University of West Florida. I completed the certificate with a 4.0 GPA in December 2021 and enrolled in the full Master of Science 
               in Data Science program shortly after. I am expected to complete the program in December 2022. I am ready to begin working in the field of data science and use the knowledge 
               I have gained during my classes.</p>
              <hr>
            <h3>Skills</h3>
            <p>During my undergraduate degree I mostly used Java, some Python, and some Angular to complete class assignments and projects. Working at Navy Federal I have switched to VB.NET 
               and C#.NET to build windows form apps and ASP webpages. I have also gained a lot of experience using Microsoft SQL Server to create reports, retrieve data from outside sources, 
               build infrastructure for different applications, and read/format/write data for file drops. In my graduate program I have spent time working with SAS and R to analyze data.

                    This course covers the foundational concepts and principles underlying the design and implementation of programming languages. Language constructs including 
                    assignment, equality, references, aggregations, scope, encapsulation, and parameter passing are discussed. A central theme is how a particular language 
                    construct relates to the concept of equational reasoning (referential transparency). Formal notations for describing syntax and semantics are presented.

                    This course emphasizes our current dependence on information technology and how its security in cyberspace (or lack thereof) is shaping the global landscape. 
                    Several historical and contemporary global events that have been influenced by the exploitation of information technology motivates topics on cyber crime, 
                    malware, intrusion detection, cryptography, among others, and how to secure one's own data and computer system. Several aspects of this course are geared 
                    towards developing an understanding of the "cyberspace" as a new medium that breaks all geographical boundaries, while highlighting noticeable influences on 
                    it from social, political, economic and cultural factors of a geographical region.
